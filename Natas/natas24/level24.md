- This one also has a password input field again
- The source code is short this time without much to do except something to do with php's strcmp
- I had no idea what to really do with the strcmp until I found some references that stated that strcmp returns 0 if something other than a string is given
- To submit something other than a string, we just need to adjust the GET request parameters to an array like so
