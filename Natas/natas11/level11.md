- There’s some source code to look through…
    - It’s slightly longer than previous levels, but there are a number of things that stand out
        - The cookie on the page is set here, saving showpassword and bgcolor
        - The cookie is encrypted with XOR, and also 
            - This XOR key is hidden
- First, we need to extract a XOR key
    - We take a little peek at the Cookie using EditThisCookie
    - Write a program decoding a key from the found Cookie (decodeXOR.php)
        - qw8J
- Next, we need to make a new cookie to put in place of the old one that has showpassword == “yes”
    - Write a program, and encode a new cookie (encodeCookie.php)
        - ClVLIh4ASCsCBE8lAxMacFMOXTlTWxooFhRXJh4FGnBTVF4sFxFeLFMK
- Edit the cookie using EditThisCookie to the newly generated one
