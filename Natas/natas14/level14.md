- This time we need to log in!
- Looking through the source code we can see some traces of SQL, a databasing language
    - SQL usually means SQL injections, which are where the user is unwittingly allowed to inject arbitrary SQL code into the server's database
- There are a few ways to do this, but for now we'll do a simple ""="" is always true
    - Input
        - Username: " OR ""="
        - Password: " OR ""="
    - Based on the source code it should appear to the SQL interpreter as 
        - SELECT * from users where username="" OR ""="" and password="" OR ""=""
    - When SQL is given an always true statement, it'll give back all the users instead of a specific one
- Once we log in, it gives us the flag
