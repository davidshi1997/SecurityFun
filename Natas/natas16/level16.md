- This time we're given a program that let's us check if a word exists in a dictionary
    - In the source code, we can see this is done with the grep command
    - However, there are a few illegal characters that make it difficult to directly execute commands
- Despite the illegal characters, we can execute code directly within quotes using $()
    - However, we won't be able to see any of the results
    - We can do something similar to the previous exercise, where we instead interrogate the file
    - We choose a word that appears in the dictionary and append a grep of the password file. This way, if any result appears, the grep was not successful
- Using a Python script similar to the previous problem we can easily get the password
