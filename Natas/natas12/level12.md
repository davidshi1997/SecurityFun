## Natas Level 12 â†’ Level 13
- Go to url: http://natas12.natas.labs.overthewire.org
    - User: Natas12

- It seems like this time, we're uploading an image
- Going through a standard run through of the website, we upload the picture, which is put in as a random filename. It then takes us to a screen where it can be opened
- Taking a look at the source code directly, there are two main points of interest
    - The only checks are for file size
        - That's great for us, lots of things can be done with tiny files!
    - The server file extension is generated using a client side field
        - Editing this, we can put in any kind of file to the server
- All of this means we can easily put in some php code
- We can assume that the password file is in a similar place as the bandit files
- To make our fake jpeg
    - echo "<?php echo system(\"cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas13\"); ?>" > totallyapicture.jpg
- In addition to making a fake jpeg, it is important to make sure it's taken in as a php file
    - All we have to do is change the hidden filename field to php instead of jpg
- Upon uploading and clicking on the file, it'll execute and display the results of the php file
