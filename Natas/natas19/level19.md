## Natas Level 18 â†’ Level 19

- The same login setup this time but no source code! Let's try to do some sleuthing to figure out what's changed
- Logging in with user: admin password: password
    - The PHPSESSID is much longer and looks like a hex number, which can often be decoded into ASCII
        - Decoding 3335322d75736572 we get 352-admin
    - This implies to generate the cookie, a number is generated, the username is appended, and then the whole thing is hex encoded
    - Important to note is it seems as though the username is important in terms of the cookie, so we'll stick with admin for our logins here
- With some slight modifications, our Python script works just fine
